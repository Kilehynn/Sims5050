# Sims5050

A random experiment with Kotlin Compose to do automatically a dichotomic search on Sims 4 mods

# Context

As a player of the Sims 4 using mods from the community, I often get in troubles when an update drops.
There are no guarantee that mods won't break after each update, so Sims 4 players are used to do a 
dichotomic search on there mods to remove the broken one.

And I tried to do a little helper doing the annoying part of moving the files around.

# Used Technologies

I tried this using Kotlin and Jetbrains Framework Compose to do a desktop app
